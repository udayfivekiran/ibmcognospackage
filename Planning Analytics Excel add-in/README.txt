The uninstall does not completely remove all application files or directories during the uninstall process; therefore, you may have to perform this action manually.

If you installed more than one component in the same location, you can choose the packages to uninstall using the uninstall wizard. All components of the package will be uninstalled.

Before you begin
Before uninstalling, close all Microsoft Office applications.

Procedure
From the Start menu, click Programs, IBM Cognos for Microsoft Office, Uninstall IBM Cognos, Uninstall IBM Cognos.
The Uninstall wizard appears.

Tip: IBM Cognos for Microsoft Office was the default name of the Program Folder that was created during previous installations. If you chose another name, go to that folder to find the program.

Follow the instructions to uninstall the component.
The cognos_uninst_log.txt file records the activities that the Uninstall wizard performs while uninstalling files.

Tip: To find the log file, look in the Temp directory.
